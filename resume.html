    <p>TITLE: EARLY FLOOD DETECTION& AVOIDING SYSTEM<br>
     TEAM SIZE:6<br>
      ROLE: Team Leader, Supporter ,Advisor<br>
     TOOLS: Arduino IDE<br>
</p>
    <p> DESCRIPTION:With the goal of making the preventive measures are to be taken earlier our project speaks to the advanced techniques of internet of things based flood checking and  cautioning framework with climate anticipating. Whenever there is rain in the flood area, we use ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in the river.water flow sensor to measure the intensity of water. The controller collect the data from sensor ,processes that data and sends the alert message to the concerned department ,personnel and the public who live in hat area by sending SMS and also make voice announcement through speakers.</p>
